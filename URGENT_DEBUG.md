# 🚨 URGENT: ALL BUILDS FAILING

**I see the Vercel dashboard now. ALL deployments are failing.**

---

## 📋 WHAT I NEED FROM YOU (30 SECONDS)

**Click on the LATEST failed deployment:**
- The one from 5 minutes ago: `6a116d1`
- It will show build logs
- Scroll to the **ERROR** section
- **Copy the entire error message**
- **Paste it here**

**I need to see what the actual error is.**

---

## 🔍 WHAT TO LOOK FOR

The error will be near the bottom of the logs, something like:

```
Failed to compile.

./app/page.tsx
Error: [something]
```

OR

```
Error: Cannot find module 'X'
```

OR

```
Error: [some other error]
```

**Copy ALL the error text and share it with me.**

## ⚡ FAST FIX

Once I see the actual error, I'll:
1. Fix it immediately
2. Push to GitHub
3. Vercel will auto-deploy
4. **DONE**

---

**CLICK ON THE LATEST FAILED DEPLOYMENT → COPY THE ERROR → PASTE IT HERE**

**I'll fix it in 2 minutes.** ✅
