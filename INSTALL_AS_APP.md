## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Issue: "Add to Home Screen" option not showing (iOS)**
- **Fix:** Make sure you're using **Safari**, not Chrome or other browsers
- **Fix:** iOS 16.4+ required for full PWA support

### **Issue: Install banner doesn't appear (Android)**
- **Fix:** Open Chrome menu (⋮) → "Add to Home screen"
- **Fix:** Make sure you're on the homepage (not a subpage)

### **Issue: App icon looks generic**
- **Fix:** Reinstall (remove and add again)
- **Fix:** Clear browser cache first

### **Issue: App doesn't work offline**
- **Fix:** This is expected - CLARITY needs internet for AI analysis
- **Note:** Cached pages will still load (previously visited)

### **Issue: Can't find the app after installing**
- **iOS:** Check all home screen pages, or use Spotlight search
- **Android:** Check app drawer, or search in launcher
